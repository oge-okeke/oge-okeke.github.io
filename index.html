    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>I believe that there is a twisty plastic tube that pours into a container that fills up and drains out through another plastic tube.</p>
    <h1>Evidence/h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a black box in which no one knows what is inside. Initially, when we tested it out, in trial 1, I poured 500 milliliters of water in, but I got nothing out. I tried to pour 500 more in, then I observed a few droplets come out which then amounted to 110 milliliters of water. As a result of this, I decided to try 2 more times and started to get more and more out, specifically up to 370 milliliters. The main component of my model black box included a funnel, containers, and two tubes. Through this model, I found that as I poured water sometimes, I did not get water out, sometimes I did get water out, sometimes even more than expected. This model was tested by pouring in water and watching the movement and travel of the water. For example, when I poured in 50 milliliters I got no water out. In further studies, I poured in 500 milliliters and got 270 milliliters out. During my whole test, it all depended on how much water I put in and what was already in the tubes.</p>
