    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>I believe that there is a twisty plastic tube that pours into a container that fills up and drains out through another plastic tube.</p>
    <h1>Evidence
    <p>The mystery black box is a black box in which no one knows what is inside. Initially, when we tested it out, in trial 1, I poured 500 milliliters of water in, but I got nothing out. I tried to pour 500 more in, then I observed a few droplets come out which then amounted to 110 milliliters of water. As a result of this, I decided to try 2 more times and started to get more and more out, specifically up to 370 milliliters. The main component of my model black box included a funnel, containers, and two tubes. Through this model, I found that as I poured water sometimes, I did not get water out, sometimes I did get water out, sometimes even more than expected. This model was tested by pouring in water and watching the movement and travel of the water. For example, when I poured in 50 milliliters I got no water out. In further studies, I poured in 500 milliliters and got 270 milliliters out. During my whole test, it all depended on how much water I put in and what was already in the tubes.</p>
      <h1>Reasoning</h1>
      <p>Models are replicas or a “mock” of a real and original design. The strengths of models include the ability to communicate your ideas, perception, and ideas of the original thing we are investigating, in this case that is the black box. Also, being able to visualize something on a smaller scale to get a better understanding of how that thing works. Something that I view as a limitation is not being able to be exact and precise on getting the best replica of results. Also, models simplify the original representation we are shown. </p>
